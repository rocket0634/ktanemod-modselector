  title: Mod Selector
  description: "[h1]Info[/h1]\r\nThis mod adds some additional UI to allow dynamic
    selection/veto of all loaded mods. Deselecting mods will make them unavailable
    in Free Play mode and any missions that would normally require them.\r\n\r\nThis
    is notably useful for selecting to play with only some modules within a mod pack,
    such as Hexi's Advanced Modules, and also for configuring specific scenarios for
    practice.\r\n\r\n[h1]Overview Video[/h1]\r\nTo get the best out of the Mod Selector,
    [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wygs3M4zWbo]watch this short overview video[/url].\r\n\r\n[h1]Major
    Known Issues[/h1]\r\n[b]Multiple pages being displayed[/b]\r\nThere is a known
    issue that can sometimes cause multiple pages to appear on the tablet at a time.
    At the moment, there isn't a known fix, but I'm actively looking for a solution.
    For the time being, putting the tablet down and picking it back up will correct
    the tablet pages.\r\n\r\n[h1]Reporting Bugs/Issues[/h1]\r\nIf you've got a bug
    or issue with the mod selector, raise it as an issue [url=https://github.com/ashbash1987/ktanemod-modselector/issues]on
    my GitHub Issues page[/url].\r\n\r\n[h1]Main Version Changes[/h1]\r\nAs of v1.0.2,
    this will now save your current configuration across multiple runs of KTaNE and
    offers a far more user-friendly UI.\r\nAs of v1.0.5, this will now allow the user
    to save certain configuration profiles, which can then be reloaded at a later
    stage. It also allows the enabling and disabling of services.\r\nAs of v1.1.0,
    this will allow the enabling and disabling of bomb casings (e.g. Double Decker),
    gameplay rooms (e.g. The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down), and widgets (e.g. Two-factor
    Authentication).\r\nAs of v1.2.0, this will allow deletion of existing profiles,
    and also provides a fix to prevent bad initialisation in the case of duplicate
    mods installed.\r\nAs of v2.0.0, the Mod Selector is now a world-space object,
    much like the bomb binder, with dynamic profile merging and 2 modes of merging."
